# Purpose and Objective

## PyCon Korea welcomes all participants
The PyCon Korea Code of Conduct (hereinafter called COC) is the most basic promise that all members must observe to create a Python Community that welcomes everyone.

PyCon Korea:
*   Aims to create events that anyone can participate
*   Aims to create an atmosphere where all forms of differences are accepted and respected.
*    Aims to create a conference where all participants are treated equally regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, race, region, religion, age, social status, education, intellectual level, appearance, disability, disease, preferred diets, and so forth.
*   Aims to encourage an atmosphere that welcomes everyone.
    
    
## Why is it important to embrace all participants?
PyCon Korea believes that an attitude of respecting diversity is the source for making society and the community more abundant. In order to find solutions to solve difficult problems and help the community to continue to grow and bring about positive changes to the world, it is necessary to have various experiences and perspectives are needed. 

## PyCon Korea does not tolerate discrimination and harassment
Accordance with the Code of Conduct, the PyCon Korea Organizing Team can:
*   Intervene or restrict situations where the safety of another participant/s is/are violated or if that person is not being respected.
*   Expel participants who violated the Code of Conduct from the event, if necessary. In this case, participation fees will not be refunded.
*   Report the situation to judicial or medical institutes if necessary or if requested to do so.

## The Code of Conduct applies to all situations related to the event
The Code of Conduct applies to events hosted by Python user groups, processes accompanying the event, and to all participants taking part in such processes.
*   Applies to all participants (speakers, cooperative organizations, sponsors, volunteers, Organizing Team, etc.).
*   Applies to all communication channels to PyCon Korea Organizing Team including event dates.
*   Applies to all places, processes, and outcomes including presentation materials, venue, website, booklets, mail, social media, meetings, code repository, and other places are connected with the event or the community.

## Please read carefully
This does not contain the entire list of things that you should not do. What is more important is to truly comprehend the intent of the contents of this Code of Conduct and use it as a guideline to treat each other better. Rather than following this Code of Conduct to the letter, we would like to advice you to think about the consequences and reasoning of the specific action with the CoC in mind.

# Community
## Let’s create a welcoming mood
All participants should feel that they are welcomed, regardless of their background. People who feel hostile or unwelcomed will hesitate to take part in the community. Please create a welcoming mood to help the Python community grow.   
*   Please treat beginners or first-time visitors to the event kindly and warmly.
*   Be brave.  
    *   If you are more comfortable just listening or watching, then that is fine too. But, if you feel hesitation at a time when you want to participate in a conversation, just remember that the people who are talking actively next to you may have also met for the first time today.  
*   Please react.  
    *   A person might have had to build up the courage to come talk to you.
        *   Please answer kindly to questions or requests for assistance.
        *   Express your appreciation for responses.

*   Do not stop the speaker until he or she clearly states his or her intent that it is okay. Ask questions according to the prescribed time with the prescribed method.

## Discussions are for everybody
Many people participate in conversations in various places, like Open Space, PyCon Korea’s public Slack channel for the conference, and YouTube Channel. Always remember that the opinion of others is just as important as yours. Refrain from cutting others off or raising your voice.
*   Please take precautions so that a few people do not take excessive amounts of speaking opportunities. Let everyone have equal chances to speak.
*   Even if you have a dispute with another person, treat that person in a respectful attitude.

## Have constructive discussions
We all have different backgrounds and knowledge. It is natural for people to have different opinions.

Constructive criticism and condemnation are different. Constructive criticism can help with the development of the community and its members. But condemnation focusing on bringing others down or to hurting others is strictly prohibited. If you have a different opinion from another person, state your opinion in a respectful and proper attitude. Have an accepting attitude towards proper criticism which may help you build your knowledge base.
*   Use respectful expressions. Here are some examples of what not to do.
    *   That language/library/operating system is garbage (X)
    *   I think that the language/library/operating system has a OO weakness (O)
*   Criticize content, not people.
    *   People who believe in the OO theory are idiots (X)
    *   The OO theory does not have enough evidential support (O)
*   Concentrate on alternatives and not flaws or problems.
*   Do not try to humiliate others to show off your knowledge.

## Do not engage in one-sided propaganda or incitement
Individual thoughts and political preferences must be respected. However, one-sided propaganda or incitement that can interfere with the smooth participation in events by other participants, or that which is irrelevant to the context are prohibited.
*   Adding political slogans or similar political innuendos in presentation slides
*   Chanting and yelling slogans in groups in front of booths
*   Interfering others’ communication by promoting a content repetitively and continuously on PyCon Korea’s official social media, PyCon Korea’s public Slack channel, or PyCon Korea’s YouTube channel.

# Privacy

Always respect the intent of the person being filmed when taking a photo or video. Some people may not want to be in photos or videos.
*   All events operated by the PyCon Korea Organizing Team have plans for people who do not want to be in videos or photos.  
    *   The detailed method for expressing your intent will be notified for each event.   
*   When the event is held online, the following rules will apply:  
    *   Do not capture the presentation video without the speaker’s consent.  

## Protect personal information
*   Do not include any information that can identify someone without their permission.

Your courage can help us make a safer community.

## The Code of Conduct has the following limitations
Despite various efforts to create a safe and pleasant community, the Code of Conduct cannot provide full and complete protection for participants from all threats.
*   In the case of emergencies, request help from the staff and also file a report to the competent authorities such as the police or fire station.
